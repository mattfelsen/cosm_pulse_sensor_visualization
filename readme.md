Data was being generated by pulse sensors hooked up to arduinos and feeing the data to Cosm. Here, the data is being pulled down and the pulse rate is used to animate the bars to a corresponding speed.

Note: this needs to be hosted on a server (even locally is fine), most browsers won't allow web traffic from ajax or web sockets if the file is opened locally.
